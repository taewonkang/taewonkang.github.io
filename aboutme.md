Hi! I'm **Taewon Kang**, born at the last day of 1995, and currently a Ph.D. candidate in [School of Integrated Technology](https://sit.yonsei.ac.kr), [Yonsei University](https://yonsei.ac.kr), Korea.

I'm a member of [Intellgent Unmanned Systems Lab](https://gnss.kr), led by [Prof. Jiwon Seo](https://jwseo.com).

My research interests include _Complementary Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Systems_, _Urban & Indoor Navigation_, and _Intelligent Unmanned Systems_.
